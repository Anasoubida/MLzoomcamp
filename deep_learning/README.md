## Deep Learning

### Image Classification

This is an application of CNN Architecture to do image classification.

### Dataset

For this task we are using the "Dino or Dragon?" dataset that can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/agrigorev/dino-or-dragon).

To unzip the file of the dataset you can run this command

```bash
unzip dino-dragon.zip
```

### Image classifier

In this [notebook](https://github.com/Anasoubida/MLzoomcamp/blob/master/deep_learning/dino-dragon_classifier.ipynb) you will find the training and test of our image classification.
